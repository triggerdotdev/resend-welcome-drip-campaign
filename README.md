```ts
new Trigger({
  // Give your Trigger a stable ID
  id: "resend-welcome-drip-campaign",
  name: "Resend.com: Welcome Drip Campaign",
  // Trigger on a custom event, see https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events
  on: customEvent({
    name: "new.user",
    // Use zod to verify event payload. See https://docs.trigger.dev/guides/zod
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string(), email: z.string(), name: z.string() }),
  }),
  // The run functions gets called once per "new.user" event
  async run(event, ctx) {
    // Send the initial welcome email. See https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/resend/actions/send-email
    await resend.sendEmail("üìß welcome", {
      from: FROM_EMAIL,
      replyTo: REPLY_TO_EMAIL,
      to: event.email,
      subject: "Welcome to Acme.dev!",
      react: <WelcomeEmail name={event.name} />,
    });

    // Wait for 1 hour. See https://docs.trigger.dev/functions/delays
    await ctx.waitFor("‚è≤", { hours: 1 });

    // Send a tips email
    await resend.sendEmail("üìß tips", {
      from: FROM_EMAIL,
      replyTo: REPLY_TO_EMAIL,
      to: event.email,
      subject: "3 tips to get the most out of Acme.dev",
      react: <TipsEmail name={event.name} />,
    });

    return event;
  },
}).listen();
```

## üîß Install

You can easily create a new project interactively based on this template by running:

```sh
npx create-trigger@latest resend-welcome-drip-campaign
# or
yarn create trigger resend-welcome-drip-campaign
# or
pnpm create trigger@latest resend-welcome-drip-campaign
```

Follow the instructions in the CLI to get up and running locally in <30s.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customize

After following the install instructions above, you can run the email preview server and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```sh
npm run emails
```

You can now edit the emails:

- [welcomeEmail.tsx](src/emails/welcomeEmail.tsx)
- [tipsEmail.tsx](src/emails/tipsEmail.tsx)

### From, Reply To, and Subject lines

You can customize the `from` and `replyTo` options by setting the `FROM_EMAIL` and `REPLY_TO_EMAIL` environment variables:

```
FROM_EMAIL="Trigger.dev <eric@email.trigger.dev>"
REPLY_TO_EMAIL="Eric <eric@trigger.dev>"
```

To customize the subject lines, edit the [index.tsx](src/index.tsx) file.

### Customize the drippiness

You can customize the delays between emails by editing the `ctx.waitFor` call:

```ts
await ctx.waitFor("‚è≤", { hours: 1 });
```

You can also make your drip campaigns smarter by connecting to your own database and conditionally sending different emails depending on what the user does. To see an example of that check out our [resend example](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev-examples/blob/main/src/examples/resend.tsx).

## üß™ Test it

After successfully running this template locally, head over to your [Trigger.dev Dashboard](https://app.trigger.dev) and you should see your newly created workflow:

![workflow list](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/c84a7d7c-8cf4-48e9-475d-9bcb30f3c300/width=1200)

Click on the workflow in the list and you should come to the Workflow overview page:

![workflow overview](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/8ce61584-6ad9-411b-41a8-2dae9d612400/width=1200)

Click on the "Test your workflow" button and fill in the JSON needed for [this workflow's](src/index.tsx#L14) customEvent Trigger:

![workflow test](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/64367e7d-2aa0-43a1-f1db-ac84e02e4f00/width=1200)

After click "Run Test" you'll be redirected to the Run Details page and you should see a prompt for entering your Resend.com API Key:

> If you don't have a Resend account, you can sign up using our [special queue jump link](https://resend.com/secret?ref=trigger). Once signed up, go to [Domains](https://resend.com/domains), add your own domain, and verify the DNS records.

![api key](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/c4914a82-32b0-4edc-f046-124213c3df00/width=1200)

After hitting "Save" the Run will pickup where it left off and make the request to Resend.com to send your email. You can even see a preview of the email right inside the step:

![preview](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/e5cc5b2a-cf4b-476b-73c4-217cf98ffc00/width=1200)

## üì∫ Go Live

After you are happy with your campaign and deploy it live to Render.com (or some other hosting service), you can send custom events that Trigger your workflow using the [sendEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/reference/send-event) function from the `@trigger.dev/sdk`, or simply by making requests to our [`events`](https://docs.trigger.dev/api-reference/events/sendEvent) API endpoint.

Here is an example of sending the custom event to trigger the workflow contained in this repo using `fetch`:

```ts
const eventId = ulid();
const event = {
  name: "new.user",
  payload: {
    id: "user_1234",
    email: "eric@trigger.dev",
    name: "Eric",
  },
};

const response = await fetch("https://app.trigger.dev/api/v1/events", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: eventId,
    event,
  }),
});
```
