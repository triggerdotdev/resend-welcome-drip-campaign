## ‚ú® Trigger.dev Welcome Drip Campaign with Resend.com

This repo contains a [customEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events) Trigger that will send an example drip email campaign using [Resend.com](https://resend.com/) and [react.email](https://react.email/)

> Resend.com is currently in private beta, but if you signup for their waitlist, give us a shout on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/CzBqJnYq9r) and we'll help you get in.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customize

We've included two example emails that you should customize to your needs. You can use the react.email preview server locally to preview the emails and live edit them.

First clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/triggerdotdev/resend-welcome-drip-campaign.git
cd resend-welcome-drip-campaign
npm install
```

Then you can run the email preview server and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```sh
npm run emails
```

You can now edit the emails:

- [welcomeEmail.tsx](src/emails/welcomeEmail.tsx)
- [tipsEmail.tsx](src/emails/tipsEmail.tsx)

### From, Reply To, and Subject lines

You can customize the `from` and `replyTo` options by setting the `FROM_EMAIL` and `REPLY_TO_EMAIL` environment variables:

```
FROM_EMAIL="Trigger.dev <eric@email.trigger.dev>"
REPLY_TO_EMAIL="Eric <eric@trigger.dev>"
```

To customize the subject lines, edit the [index.tsx](src/index.tsx) file.

### Customize the drippiness

You can customize the delays between emails by editing the `ctx.waitFor` call:

```ts
await ctx.waitFor("‚è≤", { hours: 1 });
```

You can also make your drip campaigns smarter by connecting to your own database and conditionally sending different emails depending on what the user does. To see an example of that check out our [resend example](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev-examples/blob/main/src/examples/resend.tsx).

## üöÄ Deploy

We've made it really easy to deploy this repo to Render.com, if you don't already have a Node.js server to host your triggers.

[Render.com](https://render.com) is a super-fast way to deploy webapps and servers (think of it like a modern Heroku)

## üíª Run locally

First, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/triggerdotdev/resend-welcome-drip-campaign.git
cd resend-welcome-drip-campaign
npm install
```

Then create a `.env` file with your development Trigger.dev API Key:

```sh
echo "TRIGGER_API_KEY=<APIKEY>" >> .env
```

And finally you are ready to run the process:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should see a message like the following:

```
[trigger.dev]  ‚ú® Connected and listening for events [resend-welcome-drip-campaign]
```
