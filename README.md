## ✨ Trigger.dev Welcome Drip Campaign with Resend.com

This repo contains a [customEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events) Trigger that will send an example drip email campaign using [Resend.com](https://resend.com/) and (react.email)(https://react.email/)

> Resend.com is currently in private beta, but if you signup for their waitlist, give us a shout on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/CzBqJnYq9r) and we'll help you get in.

## ✍️ Customize

We've included two example emails that you should customize to your needs. You can use the react.email preview server locally to preview the emails and live edit them.

First clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/triggerdotdev/resend-welcome-drip-campaign.git
cd resend-welcome-drip-campaign
npm install
```

Then you can run the email preview server and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```sh
npm run emails
```

## 🚀 Deploy

We've made it really easy to deploy this repo to Render.com, if you don't already have a Node.js server to host your triggers.

[Render.com](https://render.com) is a super-fast way to deploy webapps and servers (think of it like a modern Heroku)
